Are software installed at your computer up-to-date? If they are not which vulnerabilities they have? Vulmap is a project to give these answers to end-users and cybersecurity researchers in the fastest way. You can detect vulnerabilities at your computer and their exploits without any installation. The only thing you need to do is running these scripts from the command prompt.

You can check the Github page to review the project, which is also accepted by [Defcon][defcon]{:target="_blank"} and [Blackhat][blackhat]{:target="_blank"} conferences.
